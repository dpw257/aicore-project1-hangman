# Project title: Hangman game

## Description of the project

A simple version of the game hangman to demonstrate use of classes, methods and other functions. The code involves two methods in a single class, to ask the user for a letter as input and check the input is in the correct format and hasn't been tried before, and the second method to check whether the valid guess is actually found in the word being guessed. A final function combines the two previously defined methods, asking the user to keep guessing until either their lives have run out or the word has been found. The final function calls variables from within a class that it doesn't belong to .

## Installation instructions

Download the Python file milestone_5.py to run the game.

# Usage information

The user must supply a list of words as an argument to the final function from which the code will randomly select one to be guessed in the game.
